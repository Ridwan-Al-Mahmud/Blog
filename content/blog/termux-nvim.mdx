***Termux*** is a powerful terminal emulator for Android that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on your phone without rooting it. In this blog, you will get a complete description on how to setup our termux environment for software development.       
## Installation
Go to this GitHub repo and follow the steps to download Termux *[termux/termux-app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)*.     
###### And don't install termux from **PlayStore** or you may get some errors.
## Starting Termux
Enter your first terminal session and and write these commands
```
apt update
apt upgrade
```
This will update your required packages to the newest version.
## Install Ubuntu
Let me explain, Termux pretty much provide you a lot of the functionalities out of the box but it causes some conflicts with the versions of the packages. For example if you install rust in your machine via `pkg install rust` this will install rust in your machine but it doesn't install ***`rustup`*** which is a rust installation tool. But why is it required?? When you install a *LSP( We will get to that later in the blog )* like rust-analyzer it will show an error `This platform is not supported`. That's relevant for a lot of LSPs like lua-language-server for the lua language( We will get to that later as well ), clangd ( LSP for C ) and multiple other. That's why we are going to install **`Ubuntu`** a Linux distribution. So let's install Ubuntu. Write this following command in your terminal...
```
pkg install proot-distro
```
This will install proot-distro in your machine. Proot-Distro is a tool that lets you run entire Linux distributions within your Android device including Ubuntu and multiple others. Let's install Ubuntu now...
```
pd I ubuntu
```
Wait for a while as this might take some time but With this command you have installed Ubuntu in your machine. Let's log into it...
```
pd sh ubuntu
```
By this you will enter into the distro. Remember after you exit your termux terminal. You will be logged out of the distribution. Then you will have to log in it with...
```
proot-distro login ubuntu
```
## Install required packages
We are going to use Neovim as our editor because *I can't exit Vim* And some other required packages are..
- git ( To access git commands as we will need it in the future)
- wget (To get some files across the internet )
- Python ( Because why not).         


We will install it via *apt* installer.     
     
```
apt install git wget python -y
```
This will install the required packages in your system.
## Let's configure our NeoVim configuration
###### Nerd fonts
Before configuring NeoVim let's first configure our terminal. We will first install nerd-font in our local machine. This will provide us with beautiful dev-icons and a goody font. Write this command in your terminal.
```
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/HEAD/patched-fonts/Hack/Regular/HackNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf ~/.termux/font.ttf
```
***Don't change the the path ( ~/.termux/font.ttf )***
***Install the font you like from this repo [ryanoasis/nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). And, Get to the code and install it with  `https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/HEAD/patched-fonts/{path}` .
###### NeoVim
Let's start with the part everyone likes. Configure NeoVim. If you enter NeoVim by  `vi .` or  `nvim .` It won't look good but we will make look good. Now write this command in your terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/ridwanalmahmud/init.lua.git ~/.config/nvim
```
What's this?? This is my custom Neovim configuration. What boring?!! ðŸ˜‘ You thought I was going to include the whole thing about how I configured my NeoVim?? Maybe in another blog. What's the best thing about it?? The code is written in **Lua** which is a functional scripting programming language that's well documented and the code is written in different portions so it is easy to edit anything you want in here. There's another popular choice kickstart.nvim. I will give the repo link [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). Now enter your NeoVim with  `vi .` and voila. Errors...?? You may get some errors after entering NeoVim for the first time. Mostly it will be about ***LSP( Language server protocol )*** it provides snippets, completions and much more. To fix this...
- First install the LSPs you want for what your needed language. I work with rust, go, typescript so I added them in the  ***`lsp.lua`***  file add your LSP in the  `ensure_installed`. You can see the available LSPs with the command `:Mason`
- If you followed me here and you want to install or you may like working with rust, go or typescript. Follow along with me.
- If you have any other issues than go to my GitHub and make a issue in this repo [ridwanalmahmud/init.lua](https://github.com/ridwanalmahmud/init.lua)


**Rust**.       
Installing rust may go complicated so I don't want to write the whole thing. Go to the documentation and install rust for Linux ( [Rust-docs]( https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started ) )         
**Go**                        
Install golang with....
```
apt install golang
```
**Typescript**.      
First install NodeJS...
```
apt install nodejs
```
Then, install typescript.
```
npm install typescript
```
###### Tmux
Let's install **tmux**. tmux is a powerful tool that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window. Think of it as a window manager for your command line. It's a superpowered terminal that's help your workflow in a way you'll only realize when you work with it. Install tmux with....
```
apt install tmux
```
Now we will install tpm( tmux plugins manager ) this will install the other plugins for you..
Now write `tmux new -s Session` to enter a session. 
```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
Now make a file with the name ***`.tmux.conf`***  this will have the tmux configuration. I'll share my custom .tmux.conf but you can have however you want it. That's the beauty of Vim.
```shell
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
set -ag terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:RGB"

set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix

unbind %
bind | split-window -h 

unbind '"'
bind - split-window -v

unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

bind j resize-pane -D 5
bind k resize-pane -U 5
bind l resize-pane -R 5
bind h resize-pane -L 5

bind -r m resize-pane -Z

set -g mouse on

set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection # start selecting text with "v"
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-selection # copy text with "y"

set -sg escape-time 10
set-option -g status-position top

# tpm plugin
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'

# list of tmux plugins
set -g @plugin 'christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect' # persist tmux sessions after computer restart
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
set -g @plugin 'catppuccin/tmux'

# catppuccin config

set -g @catppuccin_window_left_separator ""
set -g @catppuccin_window_right_separator " "
set -g @catppuccin_window_middle_separator " â–ˆ"
set -g @catppuccin_window_number_position "right"
set -g @catppuccin_window_default_fill "number"
set -g @catppuccin_window_default_text "#W"
set -g @catppuccin_window_current_fill "number"
set -g @catppuccin_window_current_text "#W"
set -g @catppuccin_status_modules_right "directory session"
set -g @catppuccin_status_left_separator " "
set -g @catppuccin_status_right_separator ""
set -g @catppuccin_status_fill "icon"
set -g @catppuccin_status_connect_separator "no"
set -g @catppuccin_directory_text "#{pane_current_path}"

set -g @resurrect-capture-pane-contents 'on'
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'

# Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```
Now run `Ctrl-r` and `Ctrl-a + I` this will install the necessary plugins. Check all the plugin's respective repositories to find how they function. And last but not the least *options and remaps* checkout my custom remaps and options and add or remove anything you like.
Also checkout the config and plugins folder to understand what's going on.
